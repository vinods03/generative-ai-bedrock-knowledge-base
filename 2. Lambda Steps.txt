Create lambda function - bedrockKnowledgeBaseFn.py - that invokes the Anthropic Claude text processing model.

Test the lambda function by configuring the below key-value pair as a Test event:
{
  "prompt": "how many vcores does a t2.large instance have ?"
}

Ensure lambda function has bedrock access.
