Create a REST API bedrockKnowledgeBaseAPI 

Under this, create the resource bedrock-knowledge-base-resource

Under this, create a GET method invoking the lambda function created in prior step

In "Method Request" settings, choose "Validate query string parameters and headers" and under "URL query string parameters", add "prompt" and set "required" to true.

In Integration Request, under "Mapping Templates" add: {"prompt":"$input.params('prompt')"}

In Integration Response, under "Mapping Templates" add: $input.json('$.body') (assuming the lambda function returns the image URL under the key 'body')

Test the API Gateway - Lambda integration, you should get the processed return text from lambda into API Gateway

Enable CORS and deploy API

Now test the API Gateway - Lambda  from POSTMAN and you should get the processed return text from lambda into API Gateway
Choose Method as GET, URL as: https://q5nfilc558.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/bedrock-knowledge-base-resource
Under Params, Query Params -> add Key as prompt and Value as how many vcores does a t2.large instance have
Note that, this translates the URL to https://q5nfilc558.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/bedrock-knowledge-base-resource?prompt=how many vcpus does a t2.xlarge instance have
If path parameter is used instead of query string parameter, the URL will be https://3reu9ybpyd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/bedrock-text-processing-resource/how many vcpus does a t2.xlarge instance have
This URL is important for the Angular section
