Create an S3 bucket vinodknowledgebasebucket and upload the documents needed for the knowledge base

Go to Amazon Bedrock - Knowledge bases - Create knowledge base: 
Note: Knowledge Base creation with a root user is not supported. Please sign-in with an IAM user or IAM role and try again. I used lakeformation_admin IAM user.

Create and use a new service role

Choose Amazon S3 as the data source and select the S3 bucket created above.

Used default chunking - automatically splits text into chunks of about 300 tokens.

Use default KMS key to encrypt transient data storage

Choose to delete or retain vector store data when the data source is deleted. I chose to delete.

Choose an embeddings model to convert the data that you will provide in the next step, and provide details for a vector data store in which Bedrock can store, manage, and update your embeddings. The embeddings model and vector store cannot be changed after creation of knowledge base. I chose "Titan Text Embeddings v2" and the default "Qucik create a new vector store".
Amaon will create an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless vector store on your behalf. 
This cost-efficient option is intended only for development and canâ€™t be migrated to production workload later.
You can enable redundancy (active replicas) for the vector store and also customer-managed KMS key for Amazon Opensearch Serverless vector. I did not enable these.

Create knowledge base

Once the Knowledge base is created, sync the data source - this is where you update the amazon open search vector database with the S3 docs .. whenever a new doc is uploaded in the S3 bucket, you can perform the sync once.

Now, test the Knowledge base. 
I chose the Amazon "Titan Text G1 - Premier" model for the responses from the Knowledge base. 
I tried options like:
How many vcores does a t2.large instance have ?
How do you send mails from Amazon Ec2 instances ? 
Got good / relevant replies.
